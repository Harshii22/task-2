            <p>Any construction activity without generating waste is next to impossible. Waste has become 
                an unavoidable circumstance of construction activities. In past 10 years 330,000 new homes 
                have been built in the UK so the amount of waste generated is extremely high. But it is also 
                estimated that approx. 93% of that waste is recovered and used once more. It has become legal 
                requirement for businesses to reduce, reuse and recycle before disposal. Within the UK, a 2013 
                figure proposes that out of 100% of Waste produced, 44%, 14%, 13%, 13%, 9% and 7% are 
                due to construction, commercial, mechanical, family, mining and rural exercises separately 
                (DEFRA, 2013). A study by the UK's Building Investigate Foundation (BRE) proposes that up 
                to Â£130million is accruable to the UK economy by lessening fair 5% of its development Waste
